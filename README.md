# Brushless-motor-control-system
Control the speed and direction of the brushless DC motor by using QS-909 Motor Driver






Problem definition 
In this project, I will deal with a new type of motor, which is brushless motors. We will use this type of motor due to its high torque and high rotational speed compared to brushed motors. In this project I will use QS-909 motor drive to control of the speed and direction of the brushless motor. The motor will be installed on the axis of the tire, which in turn will be at the base of the robot to move it and I will program the Arduino to do this task. 

Required Task 

â€¢	Program the Arduino to control the speed and direction of the brushless DC motor by using QS-909 motor drive 




Literature review

Brushless DC motor 
A brushless motor is a synchronous motor that uses an electronic commutator instead of the mechanical commutator found in brushed motors. Brushless motors, compared to the same brushes, have several advantages, such as higher efficiency, lower use of electrical energy, longer life, and other advantages. but a microcontroller and other electronic circuit must be used for the motor to function properly.
